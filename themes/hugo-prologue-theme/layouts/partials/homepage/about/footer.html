<p>Learning how to build robust, horizontally-scalable services using Clojure and Functional Programming principles has been my primary focus since 2013. Before that, I built web applications and automated testing suites for government, non-profit, and commercial clients. I also give internal seminars and conference talks on software development.</p>
